None



## Q&As

* **Are there constraints on which paths to take in the assignments? How to tackle those if there are any?** <br> [Answer needed]



## TODOs

* Experiment with different selection mechanisms from chapter 5.
* Most likely we'll use an *Integer Representation* (p54).
* For recombination, I'd choose the *cycle crossover* discussed on page 73. An alternative would be to choose order crossover. Interesting comparison if you ask me? (I think the latter would become unstable due to the many fluctuations in choices, i.e. the crossover would become too stochastic).
